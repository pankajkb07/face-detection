# Live Face Detection in Python (facedetection.py)
# Live Face Detection with eye in Python  (face-eye-detection.py)
This is a simple Python script for live face detection using OpenCV library. The script detects the face in the live video capture using Haar Cascade Classifier.

# Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

#### Python 3.x installed <br>
#### OpenCV 2 or higher installed <br>
#### Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection <br>

# Installation
You can install OpenCV using pip:

#### pip install opencv-python

# Usage
Clone or download the repository <br>
Navigate to the directory <br>
Run the following command to start the script: <br>

#### python live_face_detection.py

The script will start capturing video from the default camera, and will detect the face in real-time.<br>
If multiple faces are detected, it will draw a green rectangle around each face. To stop the script, press 'a' key.
